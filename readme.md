# Bot Submission: Rule-Enhanced PPO Agent
## Development Process
Our approach combines machine learning with rule-based techniques to create a robust and adaptable agent for the Brawl environment.

## Imitation Learning Foundation
We began by implementing imitation learning with a base agent that could execute fundamental game movements. This gave our ML model a strong starting point to learn essential behaviors such as:

- Basic platform navigation
- Approaching opponents effectively
- Executing jump sequences
- Avoiding falls

This imitation learning phase significantly reduced the time needed for our agent to learn viable strategies compared to training from scratch.

## SB3Agent Implementation
We chose to implement SB3Agent rather than RecurrentPPO for our core architecture, which provided several advantages:

- Training speed improved by over 5x
- More efficient hyperparameter tuning cycles
- Better scalability for our mixed-approach strategy
- Faster convergence and better performance

This efficiency allowed us to experiment with more combinations of learning approaches and rule sets during development.

## Rule-Based Safety Mechanisms
To prevent counterproductive behaviors, we integrated rule-based guardrails that override the ML model when necessary:

- Edge detection to prevent self-elimination
- Platform awareness to maintain advantageous positioning
- Recovery mechanics when in vulnerable positions
- Action filtering for situation-appropriate responses


These safety mechanisms ensured our agent wouldn't make critical mistakes while still allowing the ML model to develop creative strategies.

## Diverse Training Environment
We developed multiple rule-based opponents featuring distinct strategies:

- Edge-camping opponents
- Aggressive combo-oriented approaches
- Defensive counterpunchers
- Random but viable action sequences

By training our model against this diverse set of opponents, it learned to recognize and counter various strategies effectively. This approach created a more robust agent capable of adapting to unknown opponents in the competition environment.

## Automated Experimentation Pipeline

To efficiently explore the parameter space and identify optimal configurations, we developed an automated training and testing pipeline:

- Batch training scripts that run experiments across multiple hyperparameter combinations
- Parallel evaluation of models against diverse opponent types
- Systematic tracking of Elo ratings and win percentages for each configuration
- Automated checkpointing and model versioning

This infrastructure allowed us to test variations in:
- Entropy coefficients (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01)
- Training steps (1M, 2M, 3M)
- Self-play modes and mixing ratios
- Rule-based guardrail configurations

By automating both training and evaluation, we could rapidly iterate through configurations while maintaining consistent evaluation metrics, helping us identify which parameter combinations produced the most robust, adaptable agents.

Our final agent represents a balance between learned behaviors and rule-based safeguards, combining the adaptability of machine learning with the reliability of programmed responses.
